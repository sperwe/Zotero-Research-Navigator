## Key Findings

### Plugin Loading in Zotero 7

- Plugins run in isolated Cu.Sandbox environments
- No direct access to window/document objects in the sandbox
- UI must be created using the window parameter passed to onMainWindowLoad()
- All bootstrap functions must be in the global scope

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **UI not showing**: Use the window parameter from onMainWindowLoad, not global window
2. **Object persistence**: Plugin modifications to Zotero object may not persist across contexts
3. **Debugging**: Use Zotero.debug(), dump(), and Services.console for logging

## Usage

1. Read the analysis documents to understand Zotero 7's plugin architecture
2. Use the minimal-working-plugin as a starting template
3. Refer to research-navigator-fixed for more complex UI examples
4. Follow the test environment guide for debugging
